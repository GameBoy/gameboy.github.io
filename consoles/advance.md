Nintendo’s first 32-bit system in handheld format. In addition to the change to a landscape format, the system also added L and R buttons. Like the [Game Boy Color](color), the Game Boy Advance was fully backwards compatible and can play all official [Game Boy](gameboy) and [Game Boy Color](color) games. Some later Game Boy Color games even added Game Boy Advance enhancements in the form of changed palettes and extra features. The Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color however run on different voltages. To make the system backwards compatible the system actually has much of the hardware of a Game Boy Color, with a switch in the cartridge slot determining which hardware will run when the system is turned on.

## Backlight Kits - Autumn 2022
Flustered by this backlight list? Why not check out [this more comprehensive guide](..\wiki\backlightmods#cgb) from /u/Admiral_Butter_Crust on all the different backlight kits for CGB. Only current or relevant backlight kits are listed below, sorted by desirable features.

## Audio Mods
* **Note on "Power Cleaners".** These mods from various vendors often result in more issues than they resolve, especially for beginner modders. Consider cleaning the power switch properly, cleaning the volume wheel with contact cleaner, and replacing the capacitors if deemed [faulty](https://console5.com/wiki/Identifying_Bad_Capacitors). These mods should not be considered unless other repairs have been performed first.

* **Audio amplifier.** Note: Amplifiers amplify everything. Some Game Boys are inherently noisey. They are decades old toys designed to be as cheap as possible.
	* **[Cloud Game Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803405855279.html)**. A "wire-free" amplifier. Simple install. Amplifier powers off when headphones are inserted. Also sold at [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/products/game-boy-advance-audio-amp?variant=41161782788268).
	* **[Helder's Game Tech](https://heldergametech.com/shop/gba/gba-flex-amp/)**. A "wire-free" amplifier. Simple install with a large capacitor on the 3v3 VDD3 rail. Also sold at [RetroModding](https://www.retromodding.com/products/helders-game-tech-gba-flex-amp).

* **Replacement Speaker.** Note: Typically bad speakers are a sign of other issues with the console. Refer to the [common problems](commonissues) for additional information.
	* Drop in replacement speakers are available from [FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/clear-gba-speaker) and [Cloud Game Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803825487636.html). These are OEM shaped and specification. No shell modification is required. Also available at [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gba-audio) and [RetroModding](https://www.retromodding.com/products/funny-playing-gba-speaker). Generic 1-2W speakers are also available but typically require a [printed ring](https://www.retromodding.com/products/gameboy-speaker-housing) to fit correctly. [Written Guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Game+Boy+Advance+Speakers+Replacement/2004)

## Battery and Power Mods

* **USB Rechargeable Lithium Batteries** Several options are available from multiple manufacturers. OEM and aftermarket shells with the battery divider support rib need to be removed and cut flat to prevent damage to the lithum cell.
	* [RetroModding USB-C Battery](https://www.retromodding.com/products/game-boy-advance-rechargeable-usb-c-battery-pack) Supports play and charge with a well designed circuit. Designed for no shell modification and charging with the battery cover open. A cut battery cover allows for play and charge access.
	* [FunnyPlaying USB-C Battery](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gba-li-ion-rechargeable-battery-typec-module) Supports play and charge. Designed to use a matching battery door with a molded port cutout.
	* [Helder MegaBat](https://heldergametech.com/shop/batteries/game-boy-advance-megabat1400/) and [OC USB-C Battery](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/products/gba-game-boy-advance-1500mah-usb-c-rechargeable-battery-mod) are both TP4056 based and do not support charge and play. 

* **DIY Solutions** As all DIY mods, care should be taken with fully understanding the components used. The [TP4056 **does not support play and charge**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/ouq5by/psa_do_not_use_tp4056based_chargers_to_liion/). Caution should be taken with lithium batteries. OEM and aftermarket shells with the battery divider and support rib need to be removed and cut flat to prevent damage to the lithum cell.
	* **TP4056** does not have any regulated output and thus needs some sort of voltage reduction to output the appropriate 3V for the Game Boy. Typically a diode is used to reduce voltage. There are inherent inefficiencies with this technique. [Written Guide](https://hackaday.com/2021/02/06/gba-gets-homebrew-usb-c-charging-upgrade/)
	* **LED Battery Gauge** for lithium modded consoles. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A705K_WF-E)
	* **Internal NiMH Charger** uses a unique charge board to charge NiMH batteries while still in the console. [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMQQno4l_vs)

# Problems

Don't forget that [the common problems section](index) also has more info, such as failure to power on or speaker issues. 
 
## Cannot load games after AGS-101 screen install (or other backlight kit)

* What is it? The Game Boy will freeze upon booting and will refuse to load any games after installing a backlit LCD (AGS-101). This is caused by the metal shielding on the back of the LCD making contact with the pins on the cartridge connector on the front of the motherboard.
* How do I fix it? Simply add some insulating material between the LCD and the motherboard itself. A small piece of electrical tape is usually enough to physically separate the components.

## Power LED is always RED
Power LED is always red, even on new batteries or LED will flicker / will restart randomly or if jolted.
 
* What is it? Both of these issues are usually caused by the same problem. The power switch on the console tends to accumulate dirt and gunk and will make poor contact. This will result in your Game Boy getting worse battery life and it will significantly decrease the reliability.
* How do I fix it? You'll need to clean or replace the power switch. Please see the "Common Problems" section for more info.
  
## Original screen or AGS-101 LCD colors are washed out	
  
* What is it? OEM Game Boy screens (all of them, including the Micro) must be calibrated to the console by adjusting the trimpot on the motherboard.
* How do I fix it? Remove the rear cover or the sticker directly adjacent the battery cover and right next to the cart slot, you should see a small trimpot that looks like a large cross head screw. Adjust that slowly and check to see if the image on screen improves. The trimpot is very delicate and highly succeptible to damage so extreme care must be taken. GO SLOW. If you have access to a flash cart, running the "AGS AGING" ROM (search on TCRF) will make things significantly easier. Nintendo has an internal test tool that can be loaded and one of the images displayed by the tool will cause the LCD to flicker if it is not calibrated. [Simply display this image on screen and adjust the trim pot until the image stops flickering.](https://imgur.com/ttIFmOw) Note that this does NOT apply to any IPS kits that include their own LCD power regulators. This only applies to OEM screens and mods that use OEM screens.
