Nintendoâ€™s first 32-bit system in handheld format. In addition to the change to a landscape format, the system also added L and R buttons. Like the [Game Boy Color](color), the Game Boy Advance was fully backwards compatible and can play all official [Game Boy](gameboy) and [Game Boy Color](color) games. Some later Game Boy Color games even added Game Boy Advance enhancements in the form of changed palettes and extra features. The Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color however run on different voltages. To make the system backwards compatible the system actually has much of the hardware of a Game Boy Color, with a switch in the cartridge slot determining which hardware will run when the system is turned on.
