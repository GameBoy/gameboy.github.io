The last Game Boy, released around the same time as the 101 revision of the [Game Boy Advance SP](advancesp). This Game Boy had an incredibly small form factor, going back to the “landscape” design of the original Game Boy Advance. This was the first and only Game Boy to drop backwards compatibility, only playing [Game Boy Advance](advance) titles. Although released in fewer colours than other models, the Micro instead had face plates that be swapped out to change the look and colour of the front of the system. Finding these face plates in good condition has become difficult, although aftermarket ones are available the quality can be dubious.
