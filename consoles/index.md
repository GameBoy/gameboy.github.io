Game Boys are old and getting older. There are some common problems that many systems have, or some more specific to one model. It is highly recommended that any issues with the system be fixed before installing mods. Keep in mind that these suggestions are just guidelines and are by no means requirements for fixing issues. 

Feel free to start here for the most [common issues](../wiki/commonissues) and [common mods](../wiki/mods). Console specific repairs and mods are listed in their respective pages.
