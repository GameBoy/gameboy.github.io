The Game Boy Color was the first major hardware revision to the Game Boy line, with improved hardware and a full colour screen. This system was more a hardware refresh than a subsequent model and had full backward compatibility with all original [Game Boy](gameboy) games, with the ability to apply some basic **color palettes** to different elements. When starting original Game Boy games, the player can use different button combinations to change the colours on the screen, or to the original greyscale. This does not apply to Game Boy Color games. Below is a list of combinations:

|**D-Pad**|**None (Default)**|**A**|**B**|
|Up|Brown|Red|Dark Brown|
|Down|Pastel Mix|Orange|Yellow|
|Left|Blue|Dark Blue|Grayscale|
|Right|Green|Dark Green|Inverted|

### Audio Mods
* **Prosound.** A common mod to improve the sound quality from the Game Boy Color headphone jack. This mod requires on a clean volume wheel for optimal results.
	* [Written guide](http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/prosound/) and [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnVVYloUE1k)  
	* [Helder's alternative wiring](https://imgur.com/a/4lPGhab). This method removes RA2 and joins a set of vias with jumper wires. As there is fine soldering, this mod is considered more difficult. Like the standard Prosound mod, this bridges the volume wheel to the headphone jack and bypasses the onboard amplifier. For best results, the volume wheel should be cleaned out with isopropyl alcohol or contact cleaner.
* **Amplifiers** are not typically recommended. As with other consoles, amplifiers amplify system noise. If the speaker is not working or low, please refer to [**Common Problems**](#problems).
	* These are sold by various vendors. [RetroModding](https://www.retromodding.com/products/game-boy-advance-audio-amplifier), [Cloud Game Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003592170031.html), and [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gbc-audio/products/game-boy-color-audio-amp).

### Battery and Power Mods
* **USB rechargeable batteries.** Adding a modern necessity to a classic console. Longer battery life is not guaranteed, but adds some convenience. Note that is is based on the [TP4056 and **this does not support play and charge**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/ouq5by/psa_do_not_use_tp4056based_chargers_to_liion/). Caution should be taken with lithium batteries.
	* [Video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGUx15ZgTeQ). Caution should be taken with the TP4056 module and lithium batteries. This mod requires significant shell cuts. Requires moderate soldering skills and electronics understanding. TP4056 modules are available with Type-C connectors.
	* [Giltesa's USB-C Charging Kit](https://giltesa.com/en/2020/12/17/game-boy-color-usb-c-charging-kit). A very tidy custom TP4056 charge board that replaces the DC jack with a custom USB-C port. A battery is not included and can be sized based on the cut of the battery compartment. Moderate cutting can accept a 103050 battery with about 1600mah capacity. Requires high soldering skills with fine case mods. [[Video Guide]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7ej-SSbvo)
* **DC jack rechargeable batteries.** Keeping the classic ports and feel but adding a modern twist. Requires caution as the board and batteries generate heat.
	* [Written Guide](https://imgur.com/a/6VTvh). An advanced method of charging specific lithium batteries in a Game Boy Color. Caution should be taken. Requires shell modification, high level soldering skills, and moderate electronics understanding.
	* [Esotericsean's Alternative NiMH method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glz8QctjjtY). Using a different charge controller and standard NiMHs, a safer method is achieved to charge standard NiMH batteries. Alkalines should **never** be recharged.
	* [Funnyplaying Rechargable Mod](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/products/funnyplaying-game-boy-color-battery-mod?variant=41495870406828). This mod removes components on the GBC board in order to repurpose the DC jack to allow for 5V input to Funnyplaying's custom charge board. This board is **[TP4056 based](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/ouq5by/psa_do_not_use_tp4056based_chargers_to_liion/).** [[Video Guide]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62dikpr2PXQ)

	*   [B23N's Start/Select Nubs](https://www.shapeways.com/product/TX49QTD4B/cgb-start-select-nubs). Can be 3D printed in different materials, but designed to compliment RetroCNC or Boxy Pixel GBC buttons. 
	*   Alternatively RetroCNC and ExtremeRate button kits include matching material start select buttons. [RetroCNC](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/retrocnc/products/game-boy-color-anodized-concave-aluminum-buttons-by-retrocnc) buttons are all aluminum and require separate membraes and requires the start/select membranes to be trimmed.

### Power Issues
Aside from dead batteries, these are the most common issues that keep all Game Boys from powering on. **[Troubleshooting Guide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332487991383687169/927769085918474290/unknown.png)**
#### Dirty or damaged power switch
The most effective method to clean the power switch is to disassemble the switch and ensure everything is clean. Remove all the oxidation and carbon buildup from the inside-out. Opening the switch is the most reliable and best long term solution. Other methods may still help, but should be considered a temporary fix. CGB power switches have a tricky latch when opening up the shield. [[Video]](https://youtu.be/EVTKBHR0vVw) Cleaning the power switch is the same method as AGB. [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G946mQCkIQc)
* **Aftermarket Replacement Power Switch.** This could be an alternative to an actual proper cleaning, when the power switch is corroded beyond repair. Moderate soldering skill required. [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4zM4kig6q0&t=880s)
	* [CGS Replacement](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001633557135.html)
	* [Helder's Replacement](https://www.heldergametech.com/shop/gbc/gbc-gbp-power-switch/)
#### Burnt Fuses
* There are two fuses F1 and F2 on the system of the same value. F1 is the main system fuse, F2 is a protection fuse from the DC jack. Please refer to the **[Replacement Parts Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17RfgOaR-P8M0cC5BojwuY52GbZUefLFm82To7ja963o/)**. 
#### Corroded DC Jack
* Like other consoles this may prevent a the console from powering on. Check continuity between Pin 2 and 3 of the DC jack P4. Pins are numbered on the button side of the console. Poor continuity or high resistance is a sign of a corroded DC jack. These can be desoldered and cleaned. Open circuit on these pins disconnects the battery circuit and switched to DC power only. Replacements are available on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256802576074438.html).
### No audio
* Corrosion in the physical switch in the headphone jack is a common issue. Check continuity between Pin 4 and 5 of the headphone jack. Pins are numbered on the button side of the console. Poor continuity or high resistance is a sign of a corroded DC jack. Thse can be desoldered to be cleaned. Open circuit on these pin mutes the speaker. 
* Dead speakers can be replaced as there are OEM-fit aftermarket replacements. For Game Boy Colors,  BennVenn [explains](https://www.facebook.com/BennVennElectronics/posts/2257279161052191) that speakers that go bad are usually a sign that the capacitors should be changed.
	* Replacement speakers are available from FunnyPlaying and Cloud Game Store. FunnyPlaying speakers are clear. Cloud Game Store speakers are available in multiple colors.
		* [FunnyPlaying] also sold on [RetroModding](), [Retro Game Repair Shop](), [Zedlabz]().
		* [Cloud Game Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803825487636.html) also sold on [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gbp-audio/products/high-quality-colored-speakers-for-gbp-gbc).
	* [[Replacement Capacitors]](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gbc-power/products/game-boy-color-capacitor-replacement-set?variant=40026558202028). [[Video Guide]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD1J6rPH40E) 
		* Replacement capacitors can also be ordered in bulk. Specs are available in the **[Replacement Parts Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17RfgOaR-P8M0cC5BojwuY52GbZUefLFm82To7ja963o/)**
* Corrosion or other liquid damage when neither the jack nor the speaker is bad. Corrosion in the headphone jack area is common and this can cause a broken connection between the headphone jack and the rest of the system. This will manifest in a perfectly working switch when tested with a multimeter but the console will still not work properly. Diagnosis and repair must be done trace by trace by checking both sides of the PCB simultaneously. Please refer to the **[Board Scans](https://nintenfo.github.io/repository/systems/GBC/documentation/schematics/).**
