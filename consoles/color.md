The Game Boy Color was the first major hardware revision to the Game Boy line, with improved hardware and a full colour screen. This system had full backward compatibility with all original [Game Boy](gameboy) games, with the ability to apply some basic **colour palettes** to different elements. When starting original Game Boy games, the player can use different button combinations to change the colours on the screen, or to the original greyscale. This does not apply to Game Boy Color games. Below is a list of combinations:

|**D-Pad**|**None (Default)**|**A**|**B**|
|Up|Brown|Red|Dark Brown|
|Down|Pastel Mix|Orange|Yellow|
|Left|Blue|Dark Blue|Grayscale|
|Right|Green|Dark Green|Inverted|

## **Game Boy Color Problems**

Don't forget that [the common problems section](index) also has more info, such as failure to power-on or speaker issues. 
 
* [Game Boy Color Speaker Replacement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTU46y6HnrA) Do note that speaker failures are often accompanied by the capacitors failing. See [this video and the description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD1J6rPH40E) for more information. 

* Corrosion or other liquid damage when neither the jack nor the speaker is bad. Corrosion in the headphone jack area is common and this can cause a broken connection between the headphone jack and the rest of the system. This will manifest in a perfectly working switch when tested with a multimeter but the console will still not work properly. Diagnosis and repair must be done trace by trace by checking both sides of the PCB simultaneously.

* Prosound. A common mod to improve the sound quality from the Game Boy Color headphone jack. This mod depends on a clean volume wheel for optimal results
	* [Written guide](http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/prosound/)/[Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnVVYloUE1k)  
	* [Helder's alternative wiring](https://imgur.com/a/68JkSrJ). This method removes RA2 and joins a set of vias with jumper wires. As there is fine soldering, this mod is considered more difficult. Like the standard Prosound mod, this bridges the volume wheel to the headphone jack and bypasses the onboard amplifier.
