The Game Boy Color was the first major hardware revision to the Game Boy line, with improved hardware and a full colour screen. This system had full backward compatibility with all original [Game Boy](gameboy) games, with the ability to apply some basic colour palettes to different elements. When starting original Game Boy games, the player can use different button combinations to change the colours on the screen, or to the original greyscale. This does not apply to Game Boy Color games. Below is a list of combinations:

| Combination | Palette |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Combo1      | Red     |
| Combo2      | Green   |
| Combo3      | Blue    |
