A system exclusive to Japan, the Game Boy Light was released a mere six months before the [Game Boy Color](color). It is essentially a slightly redesigned [Game Boy Pocket](pocket) with an added electroluminescent backlight. The screen from the Game Boy Pocket can be used in a Game Boy Light, albeit without the backlight. It also uses AA batteries instead of the Game Boy Pocketâ€™s AAA batteries to help increase battery life and give it the extra power needed for the backlight.
