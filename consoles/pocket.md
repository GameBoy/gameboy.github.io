This model is a much smaller redesign of the original [Game Boy](gameboy). It uses two AAA batteries and has a slightly improved screen with a grey reflection film compared to the original Game Boy's green. Early models of the Game Boy Pocket lacked the battery indicator LED found next to the screen.
