**THIS SECTION IS STILL AN ACTIVE WORK IN PROGRESS**

There are three different styles of flash cart for Game Boy consoles, both for Game Boy (Color) and Game Boy (Advance). Game Boy (Color) carts run on all models that can play original Game Boy games (so except the Game Boy Micro) and are used to run both Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. Game Boy Advance carts will only run on Game Boy Advance models and will only run Game Boy Advance Games.

The three types are as follows, internal memory single ROM carts, internal memory multi ROM carts, and external memory multi ROM carts. 

# **Internal Memory Single ROM Carts** 

These carts imitate OEM carts in both form and function. They can only hold one game at a time, normally. Most common bootlegs are of this style. A recommended vendor for these style of carts (both GB and GBA) is [insideGadgets.](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/)

# **Internal Memory Multi ROM Carts**

These carts usually have custom controllers in the hardware to allow the menu in the software to interact with the much higher memory that these carts come with. These are more common in bootlegs, e.g. 369in1 carts. 

# **External Memory Multi ROM Carts**

These are carts that use an external memory card, usually Micro SD, for the game and save storage. The hardware is not at all reminiscent of OEM games but it allows you to build and coordinate a library of all the games you want to play and is much more reliable than the internal memory versions. Common vendors for these types of carts are [Krikzz Everdrive (GB and GBA)](https://krikzz.com/store/), [EzFlash (GB and GBA)](http://www.ezflash.cn/), and [BennVenn's El Cheapo (GB only)](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/collections/flash-carts)
