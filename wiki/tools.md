**THIS SECTION IS STILL AN ACTIVE WORK IN PROGRESS**

Looking to get started modding or repairing Game Boys? This page is to serve as a quick reference for recommended tools to have. This is by no means an exhaustive list or even a requirement.

#**Hand Tools**

Well, manual tools. There's another section with electronic hand tools so I feel that's the distinguishing characteristic. 

## Screwdrivers

To even open the Game Boy, you need some screw drivers. No exceptions. Game Boy consoles are primarily assembled with JIS and Triwing screws, some models use both, some only use JIS. JIS IS NOT PHILLIPS! A Phillips driver will work on JIS screws but technically so will a flathead driver. Getting a good toolset in advance will significantly reduce the likelihood of stripped or sheared screws. As long as you use the proper driver, you will never strip a screw and have to drill it out. 

* In most cases, the best bang/buck toolkit is the [iFixit Mako Set](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Mako-Driver-Kit--64-Precision-Bits/IF145-299)
    * A dedicated set of JIS drivers is only a few dollars cheaper than this multi set and this set comes with multiple sizes of triwing, gamebit, and various other tools for other things you might want to take apart. It's a fantastic kit for the money. Other vendors, like Wiha or Wera, also make fantastic tools but none with tripoint bits. 

If you can't swing an ifixit or equivalent kit, these are some of the specific tools you would need otherwise. These tools are much lower quality and are not always the proper size (for example, the ifixit kit comes with four different triwing bits and three are all for different Game Boy models) or even properly hardened and are somewhat likely to strip or shear screws. You can get by doing one or two mods or repairs with these but it's not recommended. 

* Gamebit driver: https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=gamebit+driver
    * The 3.8mm is for opening Game Boy and Game Boy Color games for cleaning or battery replacements or whatever. The 4.5mm driver is for SNES or N64 games. 
* Triwing screwdriver: https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=triwing+screwdriver 
    * Look for the one with the large, clear, square shaped red resin handle. The round ones tend to be lower quality and the small ones are just harder to use because it's difficult to get a good grip on them. 
    * These are for opening most older model Game Boys. Anything other than the initial batch of DMGs all the way to the last model of Game Boy Advance. These screwdrivers will work on the SP and Micro (and DS series) but are not the proper size and will potentially strip your screws and give you a hard time. You'll also need a decent Phillips driver (though JIS is still strongly recommended).
   
## Cutting Tools

If you are planning on doing any mods, you'll likely want a good set of flush cutters. [CHP-170](https://smile.amazon.com/Hakko-CHP-170-Stand-off-Maximum-Capacity/dp/B076M3ZHBV) seems to be the popular choice based on the quality of the tool and general availability. Other brands are mostly fine but these are highly regarded. You'll want these for trimming things flush like shells for IPS mods or cart reader pins for, well, IPS mods. Great for trimming wire too. 

Another good tool will be a razor blade. Bare razor blades can be used as scrapers to remove polarizers (like from UV damaged MGB or DMG screens), box cutters can be used to help trim shells to create openings or to make room for an IPS screen (flush cutters also works for this but this usually is cleaner) using the score and bend technique (repeatedly score the material with the blade and then snap off the cut on the score mark). A good pair of needle nose pliers will go well with this. No links for either because both will have very wide local availability. 

Wire strippers. If you're doing any soldering, you'll likely have wire that needs to be trimmed. If you're doing it frequently, you'll want a tool that does it for you. You can do with with a razor or with scissors (please stop using your teeth, you monster). [Klein](https://smile.amazon.com/Stripper-Cutter-Klein-Tools-11047/dp/B000I1L7GW) makes a good one. Size dedicated strippers are cheaper and work well if you're always using the same few gauges. Automatic wire strippers are much more expensive and do not usually work well on the small gauge wires that are common in this hobby (especially the cheap automatic strippers).

## Holding/gripping Tools

Pliers are really useful so they deserve a second mention. Again, no links because local availability should be overwhelming. 

A good pair of tweezers. Not the cheapo ones that come in kits, but a good "precision electronics" tweezers. Look for those keywords and you shouldn't go wrong. Ceramic tips are nice if you're doing hot air work but otherwise you want the fine point ones. [The curved tip ones are best, usually.](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=precision+tweezers) A kit is not necessary, one is good enough. Or two if you lose things often. There are better options but the price seems to go up exponentially. These are good enough. 

[Hemostat tools.](https://smile.amazon.com/Briggs-Precision-Forceps-Locking-Tweezers/dp/B00GGAAPD0/) These are surprisingly useful. They are basically the step between pliers and tweezers and the locking function comes in handy more often than you'd think. Plus, they really make you feel like a plastic surgeon. 

A PCB holder or a set of "helping hands." Both are great. Not terribly useful if you're not doing solder work though. Options range greatly and vary significantly with preference. You don't know what you like until you've already found it. 

#**Electronic Tools**

Runs on angry pixies. Either the plug in variant or the spicy pillow variant. 

## Solder Tools

You've got quite a few options here. Most people just need a basic, temperature controlled iron, and for most onsies and twosies jobs, nearly anything will do. If you want something quality that will not give you hassle or help you destroy your electronics, take a look at [this video from Voultar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdHJ3BTh_c) There is very solid advice in there from an experienced modder and even a recommendation for a specific iron. Voultar will never lead you astray. 

Hot air is also an option for soldering. While not useful for battery mods, battery replacements, or backlight installs, they are a fantastic option or may even be required for custom PCB mods or flash cart builds. If you want the best available option for hot air, [check out this video from Louis Rossmann.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYCmU6jMLo8) He may be a little bit biased because he's cheap and because he sells them, but these stations still seem highly regarded. Otherwise [eevblog has quite a few different videos on hot air.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=eevblog+hot+air)

running out of time, will pick up later. Probably should have finished the outline at least instead of focusing on filling in the outline. Oops. Just pretend this section is about a rotary tool
