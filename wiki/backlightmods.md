I, /u/Admiral_Butter_Crust or makho on discord or youtube, own *nearly* every backlight kit on the market right now for pretty much every console. I feel like that gives me a rather unique perspective on these things and it would be selfish to keep that to myself. I did actually end up making a video on just the GBC portion of this but it's a bit older and out of date now. I also ramble quite a bit so I figure that limiting myself to just text and a few pictures here and there will let me try and *succinctify* myself a bit. 

There are a few kits I am missing and I don't have any immediate plans to acquire all of them but the ones that I do have, I want to spend a few minutes to talk about. Some kits I only have older revisions of and that may make a difference so please feel free to chime in with your experiences. Where relevant, I will mention which version I have. 

# **DMG** - Game Boy

I actually own most of the DMG kits now. I have three different recommendations for "best" kit as each kit seems to have different strengths or weaknesses. Overall cheapest would be an inexpensive LED panel for modifying the OEM LCD (item #1). This is certainly a good option if you like the OEM style screen but is not an option if your LCD is missing or damaged (cracked, screen rot, horizontal lines, etc). You can go a long way in improving the contrast but the original screens are still pretty low quality and have severe ghosting issues or other display artifacts. Alternatively, a total replacement kit is also (finally) an option. My pick for ease of install, performance, and function is definitely the taobao Moon Screen (item #6). This kit gives you more features than every other kit in this list and requires absolutely zero permanent modification to your DMG. No shell modding, no permanent adhesive (to the DMG), and, aside from adding a speaker, no soldering required. Since that kit can be a bit hard to get outside China though, the Funnyplaying 'Retro Pixel' kit (item #7) is also a fantastic option. While the install is a bit more involved, the actual display image itself is bigger (slightly larger than OEM which requires shell modification) and looks proportionally better than the Moon Screen kit when installed on the DMG. 

1. Traditional backlighting methods ([console](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/E0oAAOSwBgxdm35A/s-l1600.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666796555835015169/713844571284570255/image0.jpg)) -- you can backlight the original LCD by removing the reflective layer and adding a small LED panel. Results are surprisingly decent for the cost but the effort involved to get a good result can be a bit high and, even then, you still have to deal with all of the cons of the original screen. Which means poor contrast and ghosting. There are methods to improve the contrast (biverting) and this will help significantly. The LED panels themselves can also be a bit low quality and have LED "hot spots" but there are some high quality panels available. If the hot spots really bug you and you can't salvage a good panel, you can use an electro-luminescent (EL) panel but those are generally more costly and not as bright (also come in limited colors). Image shamelessly stolen from u/MrCrono666. I have one of these built by the afore mentioned user and it is absolutely wonderful looking. Still, I prefer one of the IPS kits but my opinion on how good these mods can look has definitely been changed. 

2. BennVenn 3.0" LCD kit ([console](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0804/0095/files/3in1_540x.jpg?v=1552016880) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0804/0095/products/IMG20181026191251_360x.jpg?v=1540698675)) -- this is a replacement front PCB with a new, larger LCD on it. Other than installing a speaker and cutting the shell to reduce the bezel size, the install is relatively drop-in. The new screen is bigger but it is the correct resolution. It also still has the same (or even worse in some cases) ghosting issues and the contrast can still be inadequate. It's a decent option when in stock but other than the size, it's not considered an improvement by most. (I don't have one of these)

3. HiVision TFT kit (AIO) ([console](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/Ha1919a69ce024edbad12a9c6e588fb0cw/High-brightness-LCD-retrofit-kit-for-Gameboy-DMG-GB-DMG-GB-backlit-LCD.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246604458744610816/658732946282512394/unknown.png)) -- I don't have this kit in a DMG but I do have one in a MGB. There are two different versions and this one is the version that drops frames. Last I checked, this was also the only kit that actually came with the proper wiring. This kit significantly improves on the ghosting and contrast issues of the previous methods but the viewing angles are not that great and the LCD size itself is a big down-grade. On the plus size, the install does not require any irreversible modification. You do need to desolder the original LCD from the front board and solder the new one in place. I can't vouch for the ease of install but it doesn't look too bad as long as you don't mind soldering directly to a ribbon cable. Due to the smaller LCD, the bezels are huge. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. (I technically don't have one of these)

4. One Chip TFT kit (AIO) ([console](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/Ha1919a69ce024edbad12a9c6e588fb0cw/High-brightness-LCD-retrofit-kit-for-Gameboy-DMG-GB-DMG-GB-backlit-LCD.jpg) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/xDwyPaM.jpg)) -- I don't have this kit in a DMG but I do have one in a MGB. There are two different versions and currently only one works in a DMG and that one is the version that does not drop frames. Last I checked, this kit did not come with the wiring you needed to easily install this. You can use the ribbon cable adapter from the above kit to install this kit or you can wire it manually with the MGB ribbon cable. This kit significantly improves on the ghosting and contrast issues of the previous methods but the viewing angles are not that great and the LCD size itself is a big down-grade. On the plus size, the install does not require any irreversible modification. You do need to desolder the original LCD from the front board and solder the new one in place. I can't vouch for the ease of install but it doesn't look too bad as long as you don't mind soldering directly to a ribbon cable. Due to the smaller LCD, the bezels are huge. Presumably, [the custom color palettes that the new kit supports](https://i.imgur.com/lPubcjc.png) will work on this console too. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. (I technically don't have one of these)

5. Taobao IPS Backlight (v1 - "Rainbow Screen") ([console](https://i.redd.it/mwzcgrlso3t21.jpg) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/wkedAcF.jpg)) -- The kit looks amazing in the pictures and videos I've seen but it's difficult to get outside of China. My understanding is that this kit has been discontinued in favor of the v2 version coming soon^^^tm (which I will be getting). The v1 version is not a full front PCB replacement as it appears you have to solder it to the front board like the AIO kit above but it does fix all of the issues of all of the previous kits. The screen size is the same as stock (so it works with OEM lenses), the brightness is great, the viewing angles are incredible, the frame rate looks good, the ghosting is way better than stock (but still not perfect as it's an IPS LCD). I'm pretty stoked for my v2. Per funnyplaying, it should be ["soon"](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byy_iyBHk5l/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) but it's still unclear if that's a new kit or if that's the "v2" version of this kit. Images taken from [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/bert1n/new_backlit_ips_screen_mod_kit_for_gameboy_dmg/) made by u/TheChineseGuy2019 

6. Taobao IPS Backlight (v2 - "Moon Screen") ([console and kit](https://imgur.com/a/UGv4IL6)) -- This kit is basically the Rainbow Screen kit but more refined. Installation is significantly easier than the previous iteration and aside from having to transfer your speaker over, the kit is actually 100% drop in with no modding required. You do not need to cut up your shell and the only soldering is for the speaker. Unlike the Funnyplaying kit or the One Chip kits which use 4x and 2x scaling respectively, this kit uses 3x scaling so the image is not going to be as sharp as the funnyplaying kit but it is sharp enough to have the pixel grid enabled like the funnyplaying kit. Personally, I don't like that option but at least it is exactly that; an option. Everything on this kit is configurable, even each color of every pixel from the line grid to the DMG "color" palettes and you can save your configurations to one of eight presets. A side effect of the kit being completely drop in with no modding required is that the LCD itself is a bit smaller and is visible from the outside with a normal sized lens and the display image itself is a bit smaller. This kit has the image displayed on the LCD measuring in at 43mm wide by 38.75mm tall whereas the OC V3 IPS kit measures in at 44.5mm wide by 40.35 tall. The Funnyplaying kit will be bigger than both of these kits and I'll add the measurements as soon as I get my hands on one. All in all, I think this is the best kit yet. I'm eager to get my hands on the funnyplaying version (which as it turns out, *is* a completely different kit) but due to the trimming required for install and what we already know about the built-in configurations I'm not sure if it will be better. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqmTNd748lU))

7. Funnyplaying IPS 'Retro Pixel' Backlight ([console](https://i.imgur.com/hLTnbDB.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/GBKIT1200_2000x.jpg?v=1591593968)) -- this is basically their MGB IPS kit but with an additional replacement front board for the DMG. I'm extremely pleased with it so far. Quick tap the contrast wheel and then up or down to cycle through the palettes and long tap to toggle the pixel grid emulation on and off. The contrast wheel controls the brightness up or down when not in palette select mode (quick tap to toggle modes). The screen looks absolutely amazing and the trim required to install it is actually pretty easy. I didn't notice any egregious screen issues like dropped frames or tearing that some other kits seem to exhibit. I HIGHLY recommend using a bracket or a spacer to line it up though. The included adhesive is permanent so if you mess it up [(like I did on the MGB install),](https://youtu.be/oCpjxyfpCPw) you're stuck with it unless you want to purchase a new LCD [(less than $7 from funnyplaying).](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/dmg-gbp-after-sales-ips-lcd) You can use a stock sized lens (and that's what it comes with) but the actual display image is slightly larger than stock and might be best with the custom lens included in the kit. Part of the install is making the LCD window bigger to work with the new lens. Biggest downside is the battery life with an estimated 25~50% runtime after the install, depending on your brightness level. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/ZogFkhIbBq8))

8. One Chip IPS Backlight kit (v1) ([console](https://i.imgur.com/te9Yidf.jpg) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/GGEMw1S.png)) -- I actually got a couple of these kits to install. The v1 kits do have a pretty large flaw in that the grays are swapped but it's really easy to fix if you don't mind cutting a couple traces on the DMG or the replacement front board. For example, the console on the left is as they are shipped but the kit on the right is the one I fixed. Both kits are the same kit otherwise. This kit is a full front board replacement and the only soldering required is for attaching a speaker (and fixing the palette swap). The trimming required is very easy to do with just flush cutters and takes all of 30 seconds. The screen size is the same as stock (so it works with OEM lenses), the brightness is great, the viewing angles are incredible, the frame rate looks good, the ghosting is way better than stock (but still not perfect as it's an IPS LCD). See this [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/DDlowE5) I made that documents the issue, the fix, and several before and after images with all the color palettes. New batch kits (look for the black PCB and a v3 mark or a green pcb and a v2 mark on the front board) will not require the palette fix. It should have better contrast on the gray palette too ([left is v1 kit, right is v2 kit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332487777986019337/674133183993741323/unknown.png)). (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GARDelCYnEs))

9. One Chip IPS Backlight kit (v2) -- The install is identical to v1 EXCEPT that you do not have to swap the LCD data lines. The performance is pretty much identical as well except that the grays are correctly assigned in all palettes (instead of JUST the yellow/pink palette) and the contrast on the "gray" palette is even better. I really like this kit but the funnyplaying kit looks as though it may be even more promising if the v2 version keeps the custom palette options from v1. [Left is v1 kit, right is v2 kit.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332487777986019337/674133183993741323/unknown.png) (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DqzA0DJ3bQ))

10. One Chip IPS Backlight kit (v3) -- Very similar to the above two kits but they are now using black soldermask on the PCBs and the PCBs should be marked with "RIPS V3" as well. These kits use a new LCD that is slightly different shape (wider but shorter) so positioning brackets made for V1 or V2 will not work but otherwise everything else should be similar. The new LCD is much easier to connect to the daughterboard PCB as it uses a snap connector similar to the Funnyplaying IPS kits (but not the same, it's actually a lot bigger on this kit). V3 PCBs also reportedly fix some button contact issues as the buttons have been moved slightly on the PCB ([v2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246604458744610816/714747359166332999/image0.jpg) vs [v3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246604458744610816/714747367890354189/image1.jpg)). Performance of V2 vs V3 seems pretty much identical otherwise. Compare V2 (top) with V3 (bottom): https://i.imgur.com/ylFQC3u.jpg (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7fdn3bf8GM))

11. [Freckleshack v2.5 "Aioli" TFT kit](https://www.facebook.com/BennVennElectronics/posts/2606963102750460) -- this kit should be pretty similar to the AIO kit above in both performance and install but should be a lot better on power usage and will actually have the proper framerate. It's hard to say anything else until people start getting these kits in hand with DMG ribbons. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. 

# **MGB** - Game Boy Pocket

Like the DMG section, I have three different recommendations for "best" kit as each kit seems to have different strengths or weaknesses. Overall cheapest would be an inexpensive LED panel for modifying the OEM LCD (item #1). This is certainly a good option if you like the OEM style screen but is not an option if your LCD is missing or damaged (cracked, screen rot, vertical lines etc). You can go a long way in improving the contrast but the original screens are still pretty low quality and have severe ghosting issues or other display artifacts. Alternatively, a total replacement kit is also an option. My pick for ease of install, performance, and function is definitely the 'One Chip' version of the AIO TFT kit (item #3). This kit is pretty light on features but requires absolutely zero permanent modification to your MGB and is one of the cheapest in the list (of total replacement kits). It requires no shell modding and no permanent adhesive. If you're fine with cutting up your shell, the Funnyplaying IPS kit (item #4) is also a fantastic option. While the install is a bit more involved, the actual display image itself is bigger (slightly larger than OEM) and looks proportionally better on the MGB with the thin bezels and huge LCD.  

1. Traditional backlighting methods ([console](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/706006735252488224/711017849098862692/20200515_175038.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666796555835015169/713844571284570255/image0.jpg)) -- exactly the same as DMG except that out of the box the contrast is better. You can still bivert for marginal improvements though. Biverting a MGB does not result in as big an improvement as biverting a DMG. (image are my consoles) (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMuF9yr7r1s))

2. HiVision TFT kit (AIO) ([console](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332487777986019337/646612048460906496/DSC_0175.JPG) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/OdLacj2.png)) -- Exactly the same as DMG again. There are two different versions and both should work on this console. This is the version that drops frames. Unlike the DMG, you do not need to solder except for one wire to the power switch. Install is otherwise drop in with no other mods required. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bIAvfHBlpo))

3. One Chip TFT kit (AIO) ([console](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332487777986019337/646612048460906496/DSC_0175.JPG) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/xDwyPaM.jpg)) -- Exactly the same as DMG again.

Unlike the DMG, you do not need to solder except for one wire to the power switch. Install is otherwise drop in with no other mods required. Presumably, [the custom color palettes that the new kit supports](https://i.imgur.com/lPubcjc.png) will work on this console too.

(see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9FUfmG97KU))

4. [Funnyplaying IPS kit](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9mKUbqBT7F/) ([kit](https://i.imgur.com/GUp7rJe.jpg)) -- this is the mostly the same as their DMG IPS kit. I finally got my kit and got it installed. I'm extremely pleased with it so far. Quick tap the touch sensor to cycle through the palettes, medium tap to cycle through the palettes backwards, and long tap to toggle the pixel grid emulation on and off. The contrast wheel controls the brightness. The screen looks absolutely amazing and the trim required to install it is actually pretty easy. I HIGHLY recommend using a bracket or a spacer to line it up though. The included adhesive is permanent so if you mess it up [(like I did),](https://youtu.be/oCpjxyfpCPw) you're stuck with it unless you want to purchase a new LCD [(less than $7 from funnyplaying).](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/dmg-gbp-after-sales-ips-lcd) You can use a stock sized lens (and that's what it comes with) but the actual display image is slightly larger than stock and might be best with a custom lens that has a slightly larger opening. You'd have to modify the LCD window in the shell for this as well though. Biggest downside is the battery life but that's been an issue with the Pocket even before this kit. This kit does not help though. I've had issues booting an EZ Flash JR, especially with slightly used NiMh rechargeables. A LiPo mod is probably a good idea for a mod like this. Alternatively, this kit should also work the same way in a Game Boy Light and that will help tremendously with the battery life. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/ZogFkhIbBq8))

5. One chip IPS kit -- They are currently working on an IPS version of their kit for the Game Boy Pocket. I do not know much at this time other than it is still a work in progress and uses a different LCD compared to the Blackberry Q5 LCD that the Funnyplaying IPS kit uses. I'll be getting one of these when they are "finished."

6. [Taobao](https://2.taobao.com/item.htm?id=616270138565) IPS kit ([console](https://img.alicdn.com/bao/uploaded/i3/O1CN01SNIM0v236r2RrmpwM_!!0-fleamarket.jpg_728x728.jpg)) -- Another kit appeared on taobao and it does not appear to be either of the above two IPS kits. I had one on order but they were out of stock. [It looks really good though.](https://img.alicdn.com/bao/uploaded/i3/O1CN01k7NGBZ1bOtOjAg6Zt_!!0-fleamarket.jpg_728x728.jpg) I'm going to try and get one when these are restocked. 

7. [Freckleshack v2.5 "Aioli" TFT kit](https://www.facebook.com/BennVennElectronics/posts/2606963102750460) -- this kit should be pretty similar to the AIO kit above in both performance and install but should be a lot better on power usage and will actually have the proper framerate. It's hard to say anything else until people start getting these kits in hand with MGB ribbons. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. I do not plan on getting one of these. 

8. Other kits -- No new kits are being worked on that aren't already listed above but I'm sure that will change soon so I'll leave this item. 

# **CGB** - Game Boy Color

This is going to be a long section. There are a lot of kits. My pick for ease of install, performance, and function is definitely the 'One Chip' version of the AIO TFT kit (item #8). This kit is pretty light on features but requires absolutely zero permanent modification to your CGB and is one of the cheapest in the list (of total replacement kits). It requires no shell modding, no permanent adhesive, and no soldering. If you're fine with cutting up your shell, the Funnyplaying IPS kit (item #9) is also a fantastic option. While the install is a bit more involved, the actual display image itself is bigger (same size as OEM) and looks proportionally better on the CGB with the thin bezels and huge LCD. At least, I like the FP IPS kit until the OC IPS kit (item #10) gets those kinks worked out.

1. [Backlighting the OEM LCD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ht5q3zw1vCoMdFDzFzgIKOSc5ckwd9W1ylegf8JsnnA/edit) --  I've never tried this but I've never liked the results I've seen in images. It looks like it *can* work nicely but someone just needs to find the right combo.

2. AGS-101 / El Clono TFT adapter ([console](https://i.imgur.com/jYtWSM6.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0804/0095/products/IMG20181213111442_ea7f665d-8f3d-47ca-b914-39c85d61f3c4_360x.jpg)) -- all around not a great mod. Don't get me wrong, it was effectively the first backlight kit so of course we all went nuts for it but compared to the other options, it's not a good idea at all to build a new one with all the newer alternatives. The LCD *and* adapter ribbon are both very expensive (though the new PCB adapter has gotten cheaper, the LCD pricing has more than made up for this). The install process is one of the most difficult as it requires precisely milling out the shell to fit the huge LCD. Due to the increased DPI of GBA LCDs, the actual image on the GBC is smaller than stock as well. Finally, battery life plummets with this mod, especially compared to other kits. One of the few pros is that the colors and image quality itself is pretty good. I ended up building a GBC using BennVenn's v2.3 ribbon. I believe that the actual clones of this adapter use an older version of the firmware that is buggy with certain model GBCs but I had zero issues with my legit ribbon. (I assembled mine before I started filming youtube videos)

3. Taobao kit IPS LCD kit ("Galaxy Screen") ([console](https://i.imgur.com/IHxmiNo.jpg) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/q2HGCQQ.jpg)) -- this kit is pretty similar to the new Funnyplaying IPS kit (below) except that it's been available for a few years already. This kit saw a super limited release on taobao then was hard to get for a while. You can still get one now but the wait list (as of like a year ago) is still over a month. It requires a not insignificant amount of trimming of the shell (pretty much the same as the funnyplaying kit) and a bit of soldering. The actual display image is very nearly stock sized (42mm wide for this kit vs 43mm wide for stock). The high resolution LCD used allows the kit to use integer scaling for the GBC image. This results in a super clean look with no screen door effect (it's there still if you look really close though). The effect of the higher resolution is actually pretty similar to playing an emulator on PC with smoothing off. It's very crisp. The image quality and viewing angles are absolutely fantastic but the colors look a bit over saturated and a bit, erm, *off*. There is no way to calibrate the kit to my knowledge. When the only other kit was the above AGS-101 kit, this one of the best / highest quality kits available. Now, not so much. There are way better kits for much less money. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSlGifwcrtU))

4. Freckleshack v1/v2 TFT kit ([console (left)](https://i.imgur.com/J3V3KKc.jpg?1) and [kit](https://i.imgur.com/7bfd3pC.png)) -- The first in the new wave of transflective LCD kits. The LCD this kit uses is smaller than stock but this allows certain kits to fit without modification to the console. The LCD also is high resolution and allows for the same integer scaling as the above taobao kit. The v1/batch 1 kits in particular had some screen flickering issues that broke Pokemon Pinball but all the remainder of the v1/v2 kits still do have some minor LCD flickering quirks. These kits also all require trimming cart reader pins and cutting of the shell to fit the kit. Overall, this kit is fantastic for the money, but v2.5 should be a nice improvement. Freckleshack kits tend to have the smallest impact on battery life out of all the other GBC kits. They've all since been discontinued in favor of v2.5 but v2.5 is not out yet (old stock might still be for sale but BennVenn's stock doesn't seem to last very long. No difference between v1 and v2 kits other than brightness control (v1 has no brightness control and aside from the first batch of v1 kits, they both have the minor quirk where the black screen bezels flicker white on screen transitions). The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. However, V1 kits did not have brightness adjust. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZCmvE9a9WA))

5. McWill TFT kit ([console (right)](https://i.imgur.com/J3V3KKc.jpg?1) and [kit](https://imgur.com/a/vaIT1nB)) -- This kit came out pretty much at the same time as Freckleshack v1. It uses the exact same LCD but the install was very different. I had quite a few issues with the v1 kit but I'm told that most of them are resolved with v1.1. The install for v1.0 is complicated and way more difficult than it needs to be. The kit is drop in, except for the surface mount crystal oscillator that you have to solder on. Also, [the kit didn't even work in the first GBC I installed it in.](https://imgur.com/Ntpx7Nx) I did notice some screen tearing in this kit. I'm told that the v1.1 fixes both my issues with screen tearing and having to solder that surface mount crystal oscillator but I'll have to take someone else's word for that one. Both v1.0 and v1.1 draw so much power that on a cold boot, you have to reboot your GBC two or three times before it will start up properly. I can only recommend this kit if *literally* nothing else is in stock (unlikely) or if you want the VGA output. Oh and because I want one more thing to complain about, the PCB is glued to the LCD and the screen kit is located within the shell via the shape of the PCB. My screen was glued in crooked and there is likely no way to fix it without breaking something. Thanks McWill. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. However, these kits do not have brightness adjust. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad90WUKpQf8))

6. MidWest Embedded TFT kit ([console](https://i.imgur.com/K1MJBM8.png) and [kit](https://www.mw-embedded.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_20180605_090352413-1.jpg)) -- ~~I actually don't have one of these~~ This was also part of the first wave of transflective kits and came out pretty much at the same time as the other two. Between Freckleshack (v1 specifically) and McWill (v1.0), this seemed like the best compromise. Of those three, it was the only kit that supported brightness control and seemed to have no display related issues. However, after installing mine, I did notice a constant jittering of the screen. It does not appear to be dropping frames or tearing but it's not quite buttery smooth either. This kit has a pretty serious affect on battery life. Most people claim to get more than what MWE claims, but even those who have measured the power consumption have noted that it's very high. You do have to cut the screen bezel of the plastic shell to fit this thing. It does result in a much better visual appearance with the LCD closer to the lens though. Despite the issues, there was still a lot of thought put into the install and fit and finish of the mod and I'm still really impressed despite the minor visual issue. Honestly, it is a solid kit if not for the high battery consumption. There are still better kits for the cost though. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. Even with brightness adjust, you cannot disable the backlight with these kits, however. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxUQ4jN4vw))

7. HiVision TFT kits (AIO) ([console](https://i.imgur.com/KdcF0eb.jpg) and [kits](https://i.imgur.com/tzDRdkE.jpg)) -- This is that same Chinese kit again. It works in pretty much every Game Boy console except the Advance (I should test one in a Light...). There are several different versions of this kit in particular but the differences boil down to whether the kit is "official" or a "pirate" kit. The "official" kits came first and then the one chip manufacturer came along and started making their own with different hardware and different features. The "official" manufacturer calls the one chip kits "pirate" kits. The "official" kits seem to support more consoles (like the NeoGeo Pocket Color) but also tend to drop frames due to the frame-rate mismatch. Game Boy consoles run at 59.7 FPS or thereabout but the HiVision IC that these kits are made with is locked to 60 FPS. To make the two work together, there is a noticeable screen judder with certain games. The "pirate" kit is made with a more flexible, yet unbranded, IC that does not have to drop frames. See [this imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/KF9GLSc) for more info. The issue is not that bad though to be honest and I think either kit is still worth the money. I have both the "official" and "pirate" kits and while I prefer the pirate kit for the smooth frame rate, I think they are both still great options. The absolute best bang/buck GBC kit is the the pirate kit though this one is a close second. It's anywhere from $35-60 but the price depends entirely on the vendor and the accessories it comes with. Install is literally drop in with no soldering or shell trimming required. It is 100% reversible. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. (see one of [my installs here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUzda_H1Hks))

8. One Chip TFT kits (AIO) ([console](https://i.imgur.com/KdcF0eb.jpg) and [kits](https://i.imgur.com/lPubcjc.png)) -- I made this into a separate section from the above kit because even though there are two different manufacturers, the kits have been extremely similar up until now. It's been very difficult to even know what kit you are getting ahead of time but it looks like the one chip version of this kit has a new feature. This new feature enables custom color palette support in the same way that the One Chip IPS kit supports custom color palettes. This new feature will also help tell the two kits apart since the HiVision kit does not (yet?) support custom color palettes. Assuming everything works as expected, this is the absolute best bang/buck GBC kit. It's anywhere from $35-60 but the price depends entirely on the vendor and the accessories it comes with. Install is literally drop in with no soldering or shell trimming required. It is 100% reversible. The "pirate" kits are made by the same factory that makes the "one chip" branded IPS kits. I do not yet have one of the color palette kits but I do have one on the way. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. (see [more info on the difference between the HiVision and One Chip kits here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68uECuyASgo))
    * Apparently the new version of this kit (with the color palettes) has "a pulsing horizontal on the screen during play." They noted that this line makes it look like the screen has "ripples." ~~I still don't have one yet myself so I cannot confirm but it would match up with some other things I've heard about this kit (like it was pulled from sale until it gets an update).~~ Thanks for the confirmation, u/thor-odenson. I actually just got one of these myself and the kits appear to be fixed. I'm still investigating, however. Video will be up soon. 


9. Funnyplaying IPS kit v1 -- **THERE IS NO V2** ([console](https://i.imgur.com/Nj1x8IN.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/GBC_IPS_LCD_1000_2000x.jpg?v=1585708451)) -- I know I said the AIO kit is the best bang/buck kit but this one is too really. Just in a different way. It can be a bit more expensive on average but I think the other kit fills a niche that this one does not. The AIO TFT kit (and I suppose Freckleshack v2.5) could be installed in a limited edition GBC without having to make permanent modifications if later resale is to be a consideration. On the other hand, this kit requires a lot of irreversible trimming. *If* you don't mind doing the trimming, this is the better kit. Viewing angles are much, much better, the frame rate is synced properly, colors look great (and as accurate to the original GBC as they can be on a backlit screen), and the price/availability is much better than this kit's cousin. This is the first backlit kit that is actually OEM sized. The taobao one is a wee bit smaller but both work well with OEM sized lenses. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PySvT126Loo))

10. One Chip IPS kit v1 -- **THERE IS NO V2** ([console and kit](https://imgur.com/a/MB7mdrU)) -- Outwardly, this kit appears the same as the funnyplaying kit above because they use the exact same Blackberry Curve 9380 LCD. The difference, however, is in the function and appearance of the adapter that makes the LCD work with the GBC. The install is pretty much identical except that there is one extra touch sensor. This sensor is used to adjust the color palettes that the kit uses. While this function is not very useful on Game Boy Color games, it can be very usefull on original DMG games or palette enhanced DMG games. One such example is Pokemon Yellow (NA) since you cannot use the built in DMG palettes that the Color has. This kit, however, can override any and all color palettes, even on full color games. As is, this kit does have a few small issues though. The kit does have solder points for button based controls instead of touch sensors but per the manufacturer, these controls are actually not yet implemented (tested and confirmed). ~~Additionally, my kit seemed to have quite a few issues with booting flash carts on full brightness on any batteries that weren't fresh alkalines. When I did manage to get the flash cart booted, I would experience regular screen glitching (see the album or the install video for more info).~~ I got a replacement kit and it looks like these issues were due to a defect with my original kit. See the new linked install. This kit looks really good but until these issues (button control and frame dropping) get fixed, I can't say I recommend the kit. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/JBy1IF8cIrk))

11. [Freckleshack v2.5 "Aioli" TFT kit](https://www.facebook.com/BennVennElectronics/posts/2606963102750460) -- this kit should be pretty similar to the AIO kit above in both performance and install but should be a lot better on power usage and will actually have the proper framerate. It's hard to say anything else until people start getting these kits in hand with CGB ribbons. I know these have shipped recently but I have not heard of anyone getting theirs yet. The Palm Centro 690 LCD that this kit uses is transflective which means that with the backlight off, the LCD is perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, just like OEM LCDs. I do not plan on getting one of these. 

12. Other kits -- No new kits are being worked on that aren't already listed above but I'm sure that will change soon so I'll leave this item. There are some unconfirmed kits though. BennVenn mentioned that he was working on a "GBC XL" and an OLED kit. I don't know the details of either and I don't know if they will ever make it to market. There is also yet another kit on the way from the "One chip" makers that uses a different LCD than the BB Curve 9380 LCD. Allegedly the end result should be similar but because the new (unknown) LCD is smaller, the trimming and install is easier. I'm also hoping to talk them into using the Blackberry Q5 LCD (Funnyplaying Game Boy Pocket kit) to make a GBC XL kit but, again, that's not confirmed. 

# **AGB** - Game Boy Advance

There are a few options here that work on both GBA and GBA SP but I'm going to keep these sections separate as there are some different considerations for certain mods I believe. All of the kits have some downsides but between price and performance and availability, I like the Funnyplaying IPS v2 kit (item #7). It does require a bit of shell modification but pre modified shells are available from several vendors now. I don't think the AGS-101 TFT LCD (item #2) really holds up compared to a more modern LCD but it is still a worthwhile mention. The new taobao ('c screen') kit looks pretty promising. 

1. Front light -- Of course you can just frontlight your console. I suppose I should have included this in the GBC section but I never frontlit a GBC before. I did do a [NGPC](https://i.imgur.com/P7cK3Rj.jpg) but that's another story for another time. It's technically an option and I am just now realizing that it's one I should include in my wiki. Honestly though? Don't seriously consider it unless you are weird like me and just want one of every mod. There are two different types of frontlight panels. The first are [salvaged from older devices](https://i.imgur.com/9mUS8sQ.jpg) (like say an AGS-001 or Palm Pilot) or there are [new aftermarket panels.](http://i.imgur.com/8qU1AtJ.jpg). My experience should be pretty obvious from those images since both of those consoles are mine. If you really want a frontlight, and you cannot find a legitimate afterburner kit, just swap in a whole AGS-001 LCD. Don't bother trying to salvage the panel only. They are absurdly delicate and nearly impossible to clean (so touching it with bare fingers will ruin it). The new aftermarket kits *can* look good, so I hear, but I've yet to see one that looked as good or better than an old salvaged panel. 

2. AGS-101 TFT mod ([console](https://i.imgur.com/QOXNQ1L.jpg) and [adapter](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB12q7NSpXXXXXDXVXXq6xXFXXXv/1pcs-for-GBA-Ribbon-Cable-32pin-40-Pin-AGS-101-Backlit-Adapter-Screen-Mod-with-cable.jpg)) --  The defacto backlight most people think of in Game Boy consoles. I have two issues with this method, the first is that people are *still* cutting up AGS-101 consoles for it (despite the modern alternatives), and the second issue, a direct result of the first, is that it has made aftermarket AGS-101 consoles so absurdly expensive. Unfortunately, stock of aftermarket LCDs (honestly, I'm pretty sure they were just NOS OEM) is nearly dried up so prices have skyrocketed for this mod, but *if you already have a LCD* **AND** *if you do not have an AGS-101 console that it should go into**, this is still a good mod for consideration. As the screen itself is pretty much drop in compatible with the AGB electronics, it has by far the best battery life of any backlight AGB kit. In fact, since the LCD itself is largely just a backlit 32 pin LCD, it even makes redundant the extra voltage regulator in 40 pin AGB consoles and may even save battery life. My tests were inconclusive but a larger sample size might have better results. Anyway, this mod is basically the ideal LCD mod for an AGB. It's as authentic as an aftermarket mod can be. If it weren't for the price and that nowadays you effectively have to convert two consoles into one, it would still be a good option. I think I've done like four of them. Oh, and one more strange quirk, you do have to [adjust the potentiometer](https://imgur.com/ttIFmOw) after installing one on an AGB for optimal image quality. Most ribbon cable adapters are passive and just convert the 32/40p (AGB side) connectors over to 34p connector (AGS side) but there are some active adapters that add other features like extra brightness or brightness control. I don't really recommend these as I believe they take away from what makes this mod so great, but you do you if that's your thing. If you *need* to get one, try finding one of the 2018 reproduction batch units. They are much higher quality than the new old stock (or consoles) that the other LCDs come from and are still fully compatible. These units are identified by the "XF2018" stamp on the ribbon cable connector. (I assembled mine before I started filming youtube videos)

3. Fake AGS-101 IPS LCD ([screen](https://imgur.com/a/ernk5dQ)) -- Yeah, you read that right. Weird, huh? Well, it's basically the funnyplaying IPS mod except in the form factor of an AGS-101 LCD. It drops right into an AGS-101 console with no mods necessary and will install into an AGB with the exact same process as the original AGS-101 mod. Despite being more at home in an AGS, I put this in the AGB section because this screen seems to be commonly sold as an AGB kit with a 32 or 40 pin adapter. This has the same image size as the OEM AGS-101 LCD (unlike the IPS mod which is bigger) but it has the same 2x linear scaling as the IPS kit. It seems to be a bit harder to find for sale as it seems to be listed as an AGS-101 LCD, but most sellers will still refer to it as a "new" version or "clone" or "copy" version. It should be a bit cheaper than AGS-101 screens as well. All in all, I think it's better in every way than AGS-101 LCDs EXCEPT that the power usage much more closely resembles the IPS mods rather than the AGS-101 mods. Interestingly, this kit doesn't seem to suffer from any of the visual artifacts or bugs that the other IPS kits have (no tearing or jittering) and even the ghosting is significantly reduced. (see [my video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSNfLqfv-8))

4. Taobao IPS kit ("Galaxy Screen") ([console (bottom)](https://i.imgur.com/hyoQIuy.jpg) and [kit](https://imgur.com/a/vLYgI5x)) -- From the same person that made the taobao kit for GBC, here is the taobao kit for GBA. It looks like the same LCD to me (as the GBC version) and the electronics on board are pretty much the same. Install and functionality is the same again. It does require a not insignificant amount of shell trimming but this was the first kit that introduced linear scaling (on GBA). This kit is pretty straightforward to install despite all the trimming and soldering, but, especially with these funnyplaying IPS kits, I cannot recommend it. The price is high, the waitlist is (was?) long, and the quality is not as good as the funnyplaying IPS kit. It works, but like the GBC version, it is a battery **HAWG** and the colors seem a bit off. Also, it only works on 40 pin AGBs. The plus side is that these kits had no screen tearing or other frame rate issues and they've been on the market for a few years at this point. Nonetheless, I do not recommend it. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXXyuFz8bzU))

5. Taobao IPS kit ("C Screen") -- Not yet available. 

6. Funnyplaying IPS kit (v1) ([console](https://i.imgur.com/3f8dfkv.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/4_Pixels_in_1_IPS_Full_Viewing_Angle_GAMEBOY_ADVANCE_Replacement_Project_2000x.jpg)) -- The v1 kit was, quite possibly, one of the best things to happen to the GBA mod scene. It obviously wasn't the first aftermarket LCD kit (taobao kits have a few years on these kits) but it was the first one to really hit the US and EU markets and actually make a splash. For those unaware, taobao is not normally available outside China. It's expanded internationally in the last few years but some people in some locales and for some sellers especially still need to work through an agent and the site is still all in Chinese. Now, the v1 kit definitely had it's fair share of problems but when it came out it was about $35 USD. That made it the cheapest AGB backlight mod, ever, and especially in 2019 by a fair margin. So yeah, of course people (myself especially) were excited. It looked so damn good on paper. Now imagine everyone's disappointment when the kit got into their hands and they saw that awful screen tearing effect that resulted from the rotated LCD. It still looked amazing in pictures, but in motion it was not great and it was a deal breaker for many people. Nonetheless, I was still very pleased with my kit, especially since it would lead to a whole new generation of even better kits. This kit is no longer available and has been replaced with the v2 version. I wouldn't recommend one of these unless the price was right. V2 is better in every other way. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1PhfmW7h6Q))

7. Funnyplaying IPS kit (v2) ([console](https://i.imgur.com/mDbMjO8.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/GBA_IPS_LCD_V2_4ec0e1e7-610c-41f1-9643-1f89fe8ad183_2000x.jpg)) -- Yeah, I modded a limited edition. Get over it. The v2 kit came along shortly after the v1 kit bombed (and v1 customers could upgrade to a v2 ribbon for less than $10) and that fixed the screen tearing effect in its entirety. For GBA, this kit right here is the best bang/buck kit. That's not to say there aren't any issues, however. When playing emulators via a flash cart (NES especially) or any of the NES classic GBA games, there are some [visual artifacts on the LCD.](https://i.redd.it/vzjxxfkhv1m31.jpg) Additionally, there are quite a few games that will show flashing sprites. This flashing is technically not a bug rather a sneak peak at a shortcut a lot of devs used on the GB and GBA. The LCDs had such poor refresh rates that it was a cheap way (as in, low system resources) to achieve transparency. On an OEM screen, this flashing blurs together with the background and just shows as transparency but the new LCD shows the actual flashing. The shell does require some irreversable trimming for install but the kit does not require any soldering (brightness control is optional). If you use the included adhesive, the install is PERMANENT. Because the DPI on this kit is smaller than OEM AGB screens (after the linear scaling), it does result in a larger display image than stock. It's not that much bigger but it does require a custom screen lens and some extra trimming but losing the little bit of space at the edges is not even noticeable in any games that I play and it does not bother me. All that to say I definitely recommend the v2 kits. For an AGB, this is probably my favorite kit. I don't really recommend the v1 kits though but I don't think those are for sale anymore except maybe in some already assembled consoles (from third parties). No, you cannot put this in a GBC with an ElClono adapter. I checked. There's a version of this kit for GBC now though. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q2K_Hgq7Qw))

8. "One chip" IPS v1 ([kit](https://imgur.com/bqvD94F)) -- This uses the same LCD as the Funnyplaying version so the outward appearance is identical. Install and performance are actually pretty damn similar. Both kits will show some flickering sprites in some games and both kits even have that odd image retention on NES games (albeit they both display different issues, check out [this direct comparison here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YezHoRNnUf8)). Even the external appearance is the same. My kit seemed to have some frame dropping issues and was a little bit more power hungry than the funnyplaying version. Unlike the funnyplaying version, this kit will store the last used brightness level and restore that next time you boot it up. If you have a choice, I think the funnyplaying version is the better buy for now but this kit is not a bad option either. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wGO7S7qhoc))

9. "One chip" IPS v2 ([kit](https://imgur.com/bqvD94F)) -- ~~In typical "one chip" fashion, they quietly released a revision without actually marking it as such. This is a software revision only so visually the kit is indistinguishable from v1. Allegedly this release fixes the stuttering that I noticed on the v1 kit and improves some of the flickering artifacts in some games. I do not have one of these kits to verify. Everything else should be identical to v1.~~ I'm actually not so sure anymore because the new "2 in 1" kit is also marked as v2. I think the "v2" designation on the kits that look like v1 is purely for marketing reasons. There may actually be a software revision for this kit that fixes the stuttering and frame dropping but I've been unable to acquire one for verification. It should be assumed that any "one chip" ribbon cable kit that is marked as "v2" should be assumed to be the initial version that I reviewed above. 

10. "One chip" IPS "2 in 1" ([kit](https://i.imgur.com/sicNDDE.jpg)) -- The "2 in 1" versions of this kit are actually shipping with [a new brand of LCD which is considered lower quality than the original.](https://youtu.be/-1Gcq7mMjPw) The old LG LCD is still 100% compatible but these come with Toppoly LCDs instead. Install and performance are actually pretty damn similar to the v1 version and the funnyplaying version. Both kits will show some flickering sprites in some games and both kits even have that odd image retention on NES games. However, it looks like the frame dropping issue has been resolved on this version and [a new color palette/filter feature](https://imgur.com/a/wYgLPUt) has been introduced. This kit comes with both wired control support and touch sensor control support for solderless installs. Unlike the funnyplaying version, this kit will store the last used brightness level and color filter and restore that next time you boot it up. If you have a choice, I think the funnyplaying version is the better buy for now but this kit is not a bad option either. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/GmUZrIjrxHQ))

11. insideGadgets Micro TFT adapter ([console](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_6392.jpg) and [kit](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_6425-2.jpg)) -- Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what it looks like. 100% reversable and when all is said and done, probably the cheapest backlight kit right now. It does require using a Game Boy Micro LCD, but those are still available on the aftermarket and for reasonably cheap. This kit would go well with a custom screen lens to hide the massive gaps with bezels. The install is rather difficult due to the extreme thickness of the stacked components. It requires bending ribbon cables to a degree that makes most people (well, me at least) uncomfortable. The brightness is very low to start but it can be modded to be brighter. When installed in an AGS-001, the system power consumption actually went down which means using this LCD in place of the frontlit screen (with the light on) will result in better battery life. This is the only kit on the list that you can say that with. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/0Sy1KXxUtWM))

12. Other kits -- so BennVenn announced that he was making two kits for AGB and neither have come out yet. I'll have to wait to have an opinion on either until they are out but one is an adapter for NDSL LCDs to install in an AGB. If all goes as planned, it would be similar to the AIO kits in GBC but without the linear scaling. It should fit without irreversible mods and the image will be smaller but it will still likely be an improvement over stock. Another kit was his version of the funnyplaying **v1** kit. I don't know how likely the NDSL kit is after the funnyplaying kit came out or if BV's other kit is still in development ever since the funnyplaying v2 kit came out, but it's just always worth consideration that something else is always on the horizon. Because BennVenn knows what he's doing with this hardware, both kits would work with all models of Game Boy Advance (32 pin, 40 pin, and both AGS-001 and AGS-101 models) unlike the taobao kit that only works on 40 pin models. The one chip kits are also getting a new revision. I'm not sure what features are planned (if any) but the difference will be that the main electronics for the adapter will be on a rigid PCB instead of a flex PCB. See the one chip GBC IPS kit for an example of that. 

# **AGS** - Game Boy Advance SP

I could leave this section empty because the GBA SP already comes in both frontlit and backlit variants. Nonetheless, there are still some mods that I know about or have done so I can still talk about them. Though, I guess I do have a lot to say about SP consoles. I like the Funnyplaying SP IPS kits  (item #4) or even just (clean) stock AGS-001s. Yeah, that's right. I like the frontlit ones. I think the AGS-101 consoles are highly over-rated. All of the kits have some downsides but between price and performance and availability, I like the Funnyplaying IPS kit.

1. Unpimp your SP ([adapter](https://i.imgur.com/PWauMf2.jpg)) -- I still don't really know why someone made this adapter. I've managed to repurpose it for another mod that I'll get to in a sec but this adapter came WELL before that other mod did. You can use it to install a non-lit 32 pin AG**B** LCD in your AGS. It works on both AGS (AGS-001) and AGT (AGS-101) motherboards. I guess you can use it to make a functional console out of that AGS-101 you shamefully cannibalized for your AGB? Nonetheless, it's there and, well, it *does* work. 

2. AGS-101 mod for AGS-001 -- Ok, I actually don't have one of these. I have regular AGS-101s though. My main complaint about those consoles is the brightness levels and this mod fixes that. If you use a brightness controller (and a voltage regulator), you can actually get much better control over brightness levels in this mod over a stock AGS-101. Otherwise, all other things are the same between a modded AGS-001 and an AGS-101. Mostly. I hear that AGS-001 consoles modded with AGS-101 screens have less ghosting but I think that has more to due with the actual LCD in the unit (the "2018" LCDs seem to perform much better than the OEM or other repro LCDs) than the mod. Seems like it could be a good option if you like AGS consoles but can't get an AGS-101 normally (like for those outside the US and select areas of EU). 

3. Funnyplaying v1 GBA IPS kit ([console](https://i.imgur.com/xh2tkM3.jpg), [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/4_Pixels_in_1_IPS_Full_Viewing_Angle_GAMEBOY_ADVANCE_Replacement_Project_2000x.jpg), and [adapter](https://i.imgur.com/2ayQTau.png)) -- I did this mod before both the SP variant of the funnyplaying GBA mod and the funnyplaying gba v2 mod came out. Why? Because I can. I like GBA SP consoles. And I had a GBA SP console with a really bad screen. It had mold damage. Anyway, yeah, you can just use a v2 kit or even get the SP kit in particular. My mod ended up using a lens from a v2 kit because the v1 lenses were offset. Because I used a v1 ribbon, my kit has all the problems of the v1 kits but there is no reason you cannot use a v2 ribbon. All you need is the strange adapter I mentioned earlier for putting an AGB screen in an AGS. It works on this nicely. One advantage of using the AGB ribbon with adapter over the AGS ribbon is that you get more brightness levels and more control over brightness as you can increase or decrease instead of just being able to cycle levels. As of the SP version of this kit, you can buy a replacement LCD with the SP lens pre-laminated so you don't have to bother trying to fit a custom lens. This is going to be more expensive than just installing the SP version though. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YftGqoLI_kM))

4. Funnyplaying GBA SP kit v1 -- **THERE IS NO V2** ([console](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/amRFG-DqP2w/hqdefault.jpg) and [kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2481/6766/products/GBASPIPSLCDKITnologo_2000x.jpg)) -- Yeah, I modded a limited edition GBA SP too. It won't be my last. This kit is basically the funnyplaying v2 GBA kit but for SP instead. This means it has the same downsides too (image retention on NES games and transparent sprite flickering). The screen comes with a custom lens already laminated to the LCD (and it really does look amazing) and already pre-cut so that it self locates within the shell. The trimming for this install is significantly easier than the AGB install. I'd recommend it over shoving the AGB kit in and, honestly, I just recommend this kit in general. It looks really good, it's easy enough to install, and it's pretty easy to get. This is probably my favorite option for AGS consoles. I think this is a much better buy than an AGS-101 especially since the kit works on both AGS and AGT motherboards. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amRFG-DqP2w))

5. "One chip" IPS mod (v1) ([kit](https://i.imgur.com/pjZ0xAY.jpg)) -- they made one of these for the GBA SP too. Like the GBA version, the SP version is very similar to the funnyplaying equivalent. It uses the same LCD and does come with the lens already applied, same as the funnyplaying version EXCEPT that the lens IS NOT fully laminated like the funnyplaying version. This does not make a huge difference but if you install the foam behind the LCD that the kit comes with (which you are not supposed to do despite the foam being cut for install there), you will end up with a [newtonian ring issue in the middle of the LCD.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/666796555835015169/682041175779442689/WP_20200225_18_45_50_Rich_LI.jpg) Performance is pretty similar to the AGB version. My kit did not have a frame dropping issue but it did seem to have the same jittering issue that the MidwestEmbedded GBC kit had. Like the AGB version, this is not a bad kit if you have one, but if you have a choice, I'd go with the funnyplaying version instead. (see [my install here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR3bml4oqTo))

6. "One chip" IPS v2 ([kit](https://i.imgur.com/pjZ0xAY.jpg)) -- ~~In typical "one chip" fashion, they quietly released a revision without actually marking it as such. This is a software revision only so visually the kit is indistinguishable from v1. Allegedly this release fixes the stuttering that I noticed on the v1 kit and improves some of the flickering artifacts in some games. I do not have one of these kits to verify. Everything else should be identical to v1.~~ I'm actually not so sure anymore because the new "2 in 1" kit is also marked as v2. I think the "v2" designation on the kits that look like v1 is purely for marketing reasons. There may actually be a software revision for this kit that fixes the stuttering and frame dropping but I've been unable to acquire one for verification. It should be assumed that any "one chip" ribbon cable kit that is marked as "v2" should be assumed to be the initial version that I reviewed above. 

7. "One chip" IPS "2 in 1" ([kit](https://i.imgur.com/f3fUyf5.jpg)) -- This is the exact same kit as the AGB "2 in 1" version (hence the name) but with an AGS ribbon cable (34 pin) and a laminated LCD. The "2 in 1" versions of this kit are actually shipping with [a new brand of LCD which is considered lower quality than the original.](https://youtu.be/-1Gcq7mMjPw) The old LG LCD is still 100% compatible but these come with Toppoly LCDs instead. Install and performance are actually pretty damn similar to the v2 version and the funnyplaying version. Both kits will show some flickering sprites in some games and both kits even have that odd image retention on NES games. However, it looks like the frame dropping issue has been resolved on this version (from v1) and [a new color palette/filter feature](https://imgur.com/a/wYgLPUt) has been introduced. This kit comes with both wired control support and touch sensor control support for solderless installs. Unlike the funnyplaying version, this kit will store the last used brightness level and color filter and restore that next time you boot it up. If you have a choice, I think the funnyplaying version is the better buy for now but this kit is not a bad option either. (see [my install here](https://youtu.be/4gL-f7mTw5I))

Sorry about the pillar of text but don't act like you have anything better to do than talk about Game Boy mods ;)
