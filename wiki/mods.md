Confused/intimidated by the sheer number of backlight kits now? I don't blame you. I had to create an image based guide just to keep everything straight myself. There's a new section of the wiki that has a more subjective look at all the different kits: [Backlight Mods](backlightmods) (please [give feedback here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/grrsrn/my_notes_on_all_game_boy_backlight_kits/))

# Macro

Some people like to remove the top screen from a Nintendo DS or DS Lite, to create a larger Game Boy Micro we affectionately named "Macro". While this obviously isn't an official product, we've compiled some videos, guides, and mods here to help consolidate information. If you're okay with emulation, you can even perform these mods on a DSi or 3DS as well.
