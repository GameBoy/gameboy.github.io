Confused/intimidated by the sheer number of backlight kits now? I don't blame you. I had to create an image based guide just to keep everything straight myself. There's a new section of the wiki that has a more subjective look at all the different kits: [Backlight Mods](backlightmods) (please [give feedback here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/grrsrn/my_notes_on_all_game_boy_backlight_kits/))

This section has been merged with the "Consoles" pages for better organization. Please go there instead as this page will be deleted eventually.
