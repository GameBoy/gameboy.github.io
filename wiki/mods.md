**NEW** Confused/intimidated by the sheer number of backlight kits now? I don't blame you. I had to create an image based guide just to keep everything straight myself. There's a new section of the wiki that has a more subjective look at all the different kits: [Backlight Mods](backlightmods) (please [give feedback here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/grrsrn/my_notes_on_all_game_boy_backlight_kits/))

Here at r/GameBoy, we have a much larger modding community than other retro-gaming subreddits. Mods are simply modifications to the Game Boy system. They can be simple or complex. The most popular modifications add light to the screens of the older Game Boy systems that relied on external light to be seen or even retrofit a newer screen into the console. Other popular mods include painting systems for a custom look, adding rechargeable batteries to systems that didn’t have it, clearing up the fuzzy sound, or even speeding up and slowing down games. Some modders want lots of mods in their systems, some only want one or two. Whatever your preference, there are a lot of experienced modders here at r/GameBoy happy to help when you run into trouble. For some of the more popular system specific mods, see below. Not all consoles are listed because not all consoles have mod kits available. Not all mod kits are listed either but PM ~~the mods~~ /u/Admiral_Butter_Crust directly or submit a pull request ([here](https://github.com/RGameBoy/Wiki)) to correct this. Some kits may have generic versions or may be acquired through less than legitimate channels. Where applicable, the legitimate source for these kits is what is listed.

## **Game Boy Micro Mods**

* "Makho Battery Mod," a cheap, high capacity (800+mAh), and 100% reversable battery mod – [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2095F4UELI)
